As a property investor, you might be considering renting out your property through Airbnb or other short-term rental platforms such as VRBO. An airbnb calculator will help you determine how much revenue and/or profit you may make. This article explains the main solutions available to you.

Firstly, you can use [Airbnb’s free calculator][airbnb-calculator] on their website or Airdna’s free calculator. This might be a good way of getting a ball-park estimate on revenue but from the research I have performed and the discussions I’ve had with experienced hosts, I think it’s fair to say these numbers should be taken with caution as there are many variables that will impact your revenue. 

It is worth noting that [Airdna][airdna] offers paid plans that unlocks forecasts for Revenue, Average Daily Rate and occupancy by month. At that time of publishing this article, these plans range from $19.95 to $99.95 per month depending on the number of listings within a market.

The second approach is to find comparable listings on Airbnb and take note of their rates and occupancy. Taking this approach allows you to select the listings that you’ll be competing against because not every two bedroom apartment in your market will be the same.

If you are a bit of analysis geek like me then you’ll want to check and compare rates and occupancy across multiple months and listings. This can of course take hours to collate and assess. 

You may then decide to create a spreadsheet to create a financial forecast for the property you’re looking to purchase. Note: there are many good free spreadsheets available online.

This all sounds very time consuming and hard work, right? 

Well, yes it can be, and that’s why I have created [Zillstr][zillstr-home] to automate the process for you.
